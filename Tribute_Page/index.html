                <p class="para">Netaji was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him 
                    a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and 
                    Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and
                     military failure.Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large 
                     Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj.Among many in India, he is the
                      muscular hero, his saga serving as a would-be counterpoise to the many actions
                       of regeneration, negotiation, and reconciliation over a quarter-century 
                        through which the independence of India was achieved.He stood for 
                        unqualified Swaraj (self-governance), including the use of force against the British.
                        In 1938 Bose stated his opinion that the INC "should be organised on the 
                        broadest anti-imperialist front with the two-fold objective of winning 
                        political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime His 
                        collaborations with Japanese Fascism and Nazism pose serious ethical 
                        dilemmas, especially his reluctance to publicly criticize the worst excesses of German anti-Semitism
                         from 1938 onwards or to offer refuge in India to its victims.
                         Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of 
                         inspiration for the struggle against the British. Swami Vivekananda's
                          teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on 
                          social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his 
                          very young days. Bose' defiance of British authority in India made him a 
                          hero among many Indians, however his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and 
                          Imperial Japan left a legacy fraught with authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and 
                          military failure.</p>
